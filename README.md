# Password-Generator
Third project in UNH web developer program. 

# Description
The **Responsive-Portfolio** project is the second homework assignment of the November 2020/March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

This project required us to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story
 - AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
 - I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
 - SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
